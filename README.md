# FilaSens-V2-nano328PB
 FilaSens V2  is a filament motion sensor consisting of a magnetic rotation sensor 
 and an ATMega328PB for counting pulses, calculating (filament) lenght and speed, 
 a 128x32 OLED display plus filasensor runout output to connect to Marlin.

 The hardware is capable of comparing real filament motion with extruder motion 
 (via STP / DIR input) to identify transport problems (grinding, filament outage, slip)
